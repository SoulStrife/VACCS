<h1>Buffer overflow exploits</h1>
<p>It is possible for an attacker to use a buffer overflow to exploit your system.
  Since the memory layout of a program is generally known, it is possible for an
  attacker to use the buffer overflow to overwrite executable code and replace it
  with malicious code (such as giving the attacker access to a terminal). Another
  possibility is that the attacker could overwrite various variables in the program,
  causing it to run in a way not intended by the original programmer.</p>
